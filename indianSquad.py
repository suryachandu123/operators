# Function to find the ages of the players
def find_player_ages(total_age):
    # Let age of players X and Y be a
    # Age of player Z will then be a + 10
    # The equation becomes: 2a + (a + 10) = total_age
    # Simplifying: 3a + 10 = total_age
    # Therefore, a = (total_age - 10) / 3
    a = (total_age - 10) / 3
    x_age = int(a)   # Age of player X
    y_age = int(a)   # Age of player Y
    z_age = x_age + 10  # Age of player Z
    return x_age, y_age, z_age

# Input: Total age of the three players
total_age = int(input())

# Calculate ages
x_age, y_age, z_age = find_player_ages(total_age)

# Output the ages
print(x_age)
print(y_age)
print(z_age)
